Bikes Saves The Day
===================

Why does this page exist?
-------------------------

It started with a [tweet from Tesla Motors](https://twitter.com/TeslaMotors/status/723573541128527872) which stated that evey day was earth day for Tesla owners, as they save 195,000 gallons of fuel every day. That got me thinking... How much fuel is saved by people biking?

How do you know how much fuel is saved by biking?
-------------------------------------------------

I don't! This is all a very coarse estimate. I have tried to make the estimates low to avoid inflated numbers, and I've used the same flawed assumption that Tesla Motors did, that every biked kilometer is a kilometer not driven in a fossil car.

But really, what numbers are you using?
---------------------------------------

I tried finding statistics on how many kilometers are biked worldwide per day or year but couldn't find anything. The best I could find was [this page](http://www.ibike.org/library/statistics-data.htm) where I found a chart showing cycled kilometers per person and day for a number of European countries. The distance spanned between 0.1 km for Great Britain and 3.0 km for the Netherlands. I picked the third lowest number which was 0.4 km for Austria and Norway. It's a low number but not the lowest and seemed to be close to the median of the population in the given countries.

The next question is how to apply this number to the whole world's population. Austria and Norway is probably not representative for the whole world. I solved this quite arbitrarily by only applying it to 2 billion of the worlds population, assuming that the other 5 billion are out of the car loop due to beeing too poor. Car driving is a first and second world privilege.

So multiplying 0.4 kilometer with 2,000,000,000 gives us 800,000,000 biked kilometers per day. If they were driven in a car instead, how much fuel would be used? I applied a fuel efficiency of 8 l/100km or 29 MPG which is probably quite low considering it represents the average of the whole worlds car fleet *(TM seems to be using 20 MPG in their calculations)*.

With this I get an estimate of how much fuel would be used per day in the world if all biked kilometers were instead driven in a car. 

Are you bashing Tesla?
----------------------

Well, no, not really. I like what Elon Musk is trying to do with Tesla. He is forcing through a change in technology that would have been too slow in coming if it was up to the traditional car companies. This change is needed, it is just not enough.

Electrifying cars only improves on one of the many problems that cars cause. Electric cars are still inefficient, dangerous, space hogging and pacifying vehicles.

**What do you mean?**

- Using 1,500 kg of steel to move 100 kg of human, is a huge waste. The energy required to move something is proportional to its mass.
- Getting hit by an electric car is just as dangerous as getting hit by a fossil car.
- Electric cars still cause local air pollutions due to physical wear. This kind of particle pollution is very harmful to people in areas with heavy traffic.
- Electric cars cause just as much traffic jams as fossil cars do.
- Electric or fossile, we must still allocate an absurd amount of our shared space for moving and parked cars.
- Driving an electric car will still not give you exercise, lack of which is the number one cause of premature death in the industrialized world.

Considering the above, it should be clear to everyone that just changing the engines of our cars and otherwise carrying on as usual is not going to be good enough. Private cars will still be relevant in rural areas, but in the cities, we really need to change our habits.
